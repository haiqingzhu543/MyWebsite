                                My academic passion now resides at the intersection of computer science and applied mathematics, with a particular focus on theoretical aspects of computer science. 
                                This multidisciplinary approach allows me to explore the intellectual challenges and synergies between these fields, pushing me to think critically and creatively. 
                                In particular, I am interested optimization techniques and numerical methods for PDEs which unravel hidden patterns and provide valuable insights into real-world problems. 
                                On the other hand, compuational algorithms and machine learning expand the boundaries of our computational capabilities. 
                                The continuous pursuit of understanding the intricate structures that underpin our world, and how they intertwine with computer science, is what drives me to delve deeper into this fascinating domain.</p>

                                    Outside of my academic life, I find solace and excitement in two activities that provide a perfect balance to my mathematical pursuits: video gaming and traveling. 
                                    Video games have always been an outlet for me to explore virtual worlds and engage with diverse narratives, effectively honing my problem-solving skills and strategic thinking. 
                                    The immersive nature of gaming allows me to break away from the everyday routine and experience different perspectives. 
                                    Travel, on the other hand, has given me the opportunity to connect with new cultures and marvel at the beauty of our planet. 
                                    So far, I have been fortunate enough to visit Italy, Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand, China, and (of course) Australia. 
                                    Each journey has been an enriching experience, broadening my understanding of the world and inspiring me to seek out further adventures. 
                                    I am eager to continue exploring the globe, making new memories, and gaining invaluable insights that will undoubtedly shape my personal and professional growth.

                        <p class="research-abstract"> Abstract: This work is concerned with the dynamics of online cultural markets,
                            namely, attention allocation of many users on a set of digital
                            goods with infinite supply. Such dynamics are important in shaping
                            processes and outcomes in society, from trending items in entertainment,
                            collective knowledge creation, to election outcomes. The
                            outcomes of online cultural markets are susceptible to intricate
                            social influence dynamics, particularly so when the community
                            comprises consumers with heterogeneous interests. This has made
                            formal analysis of these markets improbable. In this paper, we remedy
                            this by establishing robust connections between influence dynamics
                            and optimization processes, in trial-offer markets where the
                            consumer preferences are modelled by multinomial logit. Among
                            other results, we show that the proportional-response-esque influence
                            dynamic is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent on a convex
                            objective function, thus leading to a stable and predictable outcome.
                            When all consumers are homogeneous, the objective function has
                            a natural interpretation as a weighted sum of efficiency and diversity
                            of the culture market. In simulations driven by real-world
                            preferences collected from a large-scale recommender system, we
                            observe that ranking strategies aligned with the underlying heterogeneous
                            preferences are more stable, and achieves higher efficiency
                            and diversity. More broadly, we see this work as the first step in
                            connecting computational methods for classical markets to the
                            problem area of online attention and recommender systems. We
                            hope this result paves the way to posing and answering a diverse
                            set of research questions in this area.</p>

                        <p class="research-abstract"> Abstract: This project aims to investigate the competition of online items and its impacts on
                            consumers' choices. Especially, we will focus on the cases where existences of recommender
                            systems are considered. We will first review and link the existing results in the
                            asymptotic behaviour of discrete choice models (DCM) and online attention markets.
                            Then, we will investigate the multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) model and relate it to
                            choice models. Finally, we will study the multi-type Galton–Watson branching process
                            (MTBP), which could be regarded as a theoretically well-studied simplification of the
                            MHP. We derived several relationships among DCM’s, MBP’s and MTBP’s. By linking
                            MTBPs’, MHP’s and the concept of market share, we also proposed a conjecture on the
                            asymptotic type distribution of MHP’s and verified it by simulation studies. Our work
                            presents a wide range of literature reviews and their relations to customers’ choices in
                            the online attention market, which provides solid foundations for proceeding works.</p>

                            Building upon the insights from the literature, we study a family of optimization methods specifically designed to exploit the global landscape
